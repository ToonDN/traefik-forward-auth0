# Contributing
👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍  

All help, big or small, are very welcome.
Even the smallest contribution like fixing a spelling error makes the
application better and better for each commit.

For information about how to compile, release and test the application
have a look at the [development docs](development.md). Its quite easy to get
started I hope as this is a small and simple application.

Have a look at the issue tracker for already identified tasks that I 
have planned to look at. I have marked all future features that I have
identified with Enhancement-tag.

Fork the code, implement a feature and create a Pull Request when you want feedback.
